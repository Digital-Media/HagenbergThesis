\chapter{Abstract}

\begin{english}
Large Public Display Games place a number of very specific design
requirements. Such games need to work equally well for just a few or several
simultaneous users. Also, the processes of entering, leaving or joining a
game in progress should be easily performed without interrupting the flow of
the game. This bachelor (master) thesis focuses on the development of a
framework of game mechanics that support the principle of smooth transition
gameplay. This framework will then be evaluated utilizing a prototype
implemented as a project in the fifth semester.
