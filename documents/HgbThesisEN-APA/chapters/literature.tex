The APA citation style requires different citation macros, depending on the usage and the
occurrence of the reference in the text.

\section{Narrative Citations}

In narrative references, the source is used as the subject or object of the sentence. The
year is placed after the author's name in parentheses.

Use \verb!\textcite{!\textit{keys}\verb!}! to create this kind of citation.

\subsection{Example}

\textcite{Daniel2018} give a brief introduction to \latex, whereas \textcite{Oetiker2018, Kopka2003} go into more detail.

\section{Narrative Citations within Parentheses}

If a reference is to be used within parentheses, these must be omitted from the reference itself.

The macro \verb!\nptextcite{!\textit{keys}\verb!}! considers this.

\subsection{Example}

In any case, it is recommended to obtain literature on the topic of \latex (e.g., \nptextcite{Daniel2018, Oetiker2018, Kopka2003}).

\section{Parenthetical Citations}

Parenthetical citations are used when the reference should be cited at the end of a sentence or statement.
The author's name and year are enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma.

Use \verb!\parencite{!\textit{keys}\verb!}! for this case.

\subsection{Example}

For \latex, there are short introductions \parencite{Daniel2018}, as well as more comprehensive works \parencite{Oetiker2018, Kopka2003}.
