## Sample Documents (Source Directories)

This directory contains the source files for the `hagenberg-thesis` sample documents,
each placed in its own sub-directory.
Documents are not supposed to be built (compiled) directly from these directories,
but the assoiated `zip` files in [download](../download) should be used instead.
