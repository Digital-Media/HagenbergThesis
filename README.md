# Hagenberg Thesis Document Collection (LaTeX)

## What You Find Here

This is a collection of modern LaTeX classes, style files, and example documents for authoring **Bachelor, Master, or Diploma theses** and related academic manuscripts in English and German.
Pre-configured English and German documents are available, easy to use even for LaTeX beginners, and compatible with LaTeX distributions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The document classes are immediately usable and convenient to customize.

The main document, [**HgbThesisTutorialEN**](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisTutorialEN/main.pdf) or [**HgbThesisTutorialDE**](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisTutorialDE/main.pdf), serves both as a **template** and **tutorial** for authoring a bachelor, master, or diploma thesis with LaTeX. 
Developed initially as an internal standard at the Upper Austria University of Applied Sciences in Hagenberg, this setup has become popular at several other (mostly German-speaking) institutions over the last few years.

This site is the main repository for the **hagenberg-thesis** package, which is also available on **[CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/hagenberg-thesis)** and shared by popular package repositories such as [*MikTeX*](https://miktex.org/) and [*TexLive*](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
Note that the **most recent versions are always found *here***, while only periodic [releases](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/releases) are submitted to CTAN.

## Sample Documents

Each sample document is based on a custom LaTeX document class (e.g., ``hgbthesis.cls``) and various style files  (``hgb.sty``, ...). The style files can also be used independently for other kinds of documents.
The following sample documents (with numerical citations using `numeric-comp`) are currently available:

### APA Style Documents

To use the [APA 7th edition style for citations and references](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/), the option `apa` can be used in the document's preamble. Two separate sample documents are already prepared for the use of the APA style:

| Name | Document Type | Language | PDF | ZIP | Overleaf\* |
| :--- | :--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HgbThesisEN-APA` | Minimal Thesis Template (APA-style) | English | [preview](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisEN-APA/main.pdf) | [download](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisEN-APA.zip) | [create](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisEN-APA.zip) |
| `HgbThesisDE-APA` | Minimal Thesis Template (APA-style) | German | [preview](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisDE-APA/main.pdf) | [download](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisDE-APA.zip) | [create](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/main/documents/HgbThesisDE-APA.zip) |

\*Note: A (free) account is required to open documents on **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)**.


### PDF/A Generation and Validation

All documents in this collection are set up to optionally create PDF/A-compliant output files (PDF/A-2b, to be exact).
Note that while the original documents are indeed PDF/A-compliant, any *derived* document may *not* be so. 
It is, therefore, important to **validate** the resulting PDF file before submission using one of the options listed below.
Most violations of the PDF/A standard arise from the inclusion of other PDF files, particularly graphics. 
Typical issues are related to using non-embedded fonts and incorrect or unwanted color spaces. This setup assumes sRGB colors, which should also be used when creating your own illustrations. Here are some **PDF/A validation software and services**:

* **veraPDF:** [online validation service](https://demo.verapdf.org) or [downloadable validation client](https://verapdf.org/software),
* **pdf-online:** [online validation service](https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx).


## Additional Features

The **hagenberg-thesis** classes and styles try to provide as much functionality out-of-the-box as possible while still being easy to use. Additional functionality that did not permanently find its way into the files is documented in the [wiki for this repository](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/wiki).
